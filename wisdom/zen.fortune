become a Buddha by practicing zazen?" Nangaku replied. "Do you want to attain

We all must commit wholeheartedly, moment after moment, to the life we have,
instead of fantasizing about a different life while putting down or envying
those who are supposedly living it. When I start feeling jealous of others, it’s
a warning sign that I’ve become a little bit too entranced by some idea of
myself and have lost touch with the reality of my life. Someone else seems to
better represent this idea of myself than I do, and suddenly I want his life

Zen practice, however, teaches you to completely be yourself—if you don’t, who
will? Someone’s got to hold down your corner of the universe, and no one else is

the exact same size as your presence: perfectly you-sized.

And I thought it must be a very difficult experience for each drop of water to
come down from the top of such a high mountain. It takes time, you know, a long
time, for the water finally to reach the bottom of the waterfall. And it seems
to me that our human life may be like this. We have many difficult experiences
in our life. But at the same time, I thought, the water was not originally
separated, but was one whole river. Only when it is separated does it have some
difficulty in falling. It is as if the water does not have any feeling when it
is one whole river. Only when separated into many drops can it begin to have or
to express some feeling.

. . .

Before we were born we had no feeling; we were one with the universe. This is
called "mind-only," or "essence of mind," or "big mind," After we are separated
by birth from this oneness, as the water falling from the waterfall is separated
by the wind and rocks, then we have feeling. You have difficulty because you
have feeling. You attach to the feeling you have without knowing just how this
kind of feeling is created. When you do not realize that you are one with the
river, or one with the universe, you have fear. Whether it is separated into
drops or not, water is water. Our life and death are the same thing. When we
realize this fact we have no fear of death anymore, and we have no actual
difficulty in our life.

When the water returns to its original oneness with the river, it no longer has
any individual feeling to it; it resumes its own nature, and finds composure.

When you can sit with your whole body and mind, and with the oneness of your
mind and body under the control of the universal mind, you can easily attain
this kind of right understanding. Your everyday life will be renewed without
being attached to an old erroneous interpretation of life. When you realize this
fact, you will discover how meaningless your old interpretation was, and how
much useless effort you had been making. You will find the true meaning of life,
and even though you have difficulty falling upright from the top of the
waterfall to the bottom of the mountain, you will enjoy your life.

The understanding passed down from Buddha to our time is that when you start
zazen, there is enlightenment even without any preparation. Whether you practice
zazen or not, you have Buddha nature. Because you have it, there is
enlightenment in your practice. The points we emphasize are not the stage we
attain, but the strong confidence we have in our original nature and the
sincerity of our practice.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind

When you believe in your way enlightenment is there. But when you cannot
believe in the meaning of the practice which you are doing in this moment, you
cannot do anything. You are just wandering around the goal with your monkey
mind. You are always looking for something without knowing what you are doing.
If you want to see something, you should open your eyes. When you do not
understand Bodhidharma's Zen, you are trying to look at something with your eyes
closed. We do not slight the idea of attaining enlightenment, but the most
important thing is this moment, not some day in the future. We have to make our
effort in this moment.

The basic teaching of Buddhism is the teaching of transiency, or change. That
everything changes is the basic truth for each existence. No one can deny this
truth, and all the teaching of Buddhism is condensed within it.

. . .

This teaching is also understood as the teaching of selflessness. Because each
existence is in constant change, there is no abiding self. In fact, the
self-nature of each existence is nothing but change itself, the self-nature of
all existence.

. . .

When we realize the everlasting truth of "everything changes" and find our
composure in it, we find ourselves in Nirvana.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
%
Without accepting the fact that everything changes, we cannot find perfect
composure. But unfortunately, although it is true, it is difficult for us to
accept it. Because we cannot accept the truth of transiency, we suffer. So the
cause of suffering is our non-acceptance of this truth. The teaching of the
cause of suffering and the teaching that everything changes are thus two sides
of one coin. But subjectively, transiency is the cause of our suffering.

We should find perfect existence through imperfect existence. We should find
perfection in imperfection. For us, complete perfection is not different from
imperfection. The eternal exists because of non-eternal existence. In Buddhism
it is a heretical view to expect something outside this world. We do not seek
for something besides ourselves. We should find the truth in this world, through
our difficulties, through our suffering. This is the basic teaching of Buddhism.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
%
[T]o find pleasure in suffering is the only way to accept the truth of
transiency. Without realizing how to accept this truth you cannot live in this
world. Even though you try to escape from it, your effort will be in vain. If
you think there is some other way to accept the eternal truth that everything
changes, that is your delusion. This is the basic teaching of how to live in
this world. Whatever you may feel about it, you have to accept it.

When you do something, if you fix your mind on the activity with some
confidence, the quality of your state of mind is the activity itself. When you
are concentrated on the quality of your being, you are prepared for the
activity.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
%
According to Dogen-zenji, every existence is a flashing into the vast phenomenal
world. Each existence is another expression of the quality of being itself. I
often see many stars early in the morning. The stars are nothing but the light
which has traveled at great speed many miles from the heavenly bodies. But for
me the stars are not speedy beings, but calm, steady, and peaceful beings. We
say, "In calmness there should be activity; in activity there should be
calmness."

Strictly speaking, there is no connection between I myself yesterday and I
myself in this moment; there is no connection whatsoever. Dogen-zenji said,
"Charcoal does not become ashes." Ashes are ashes; they do not belong to
charcoal. They have their own past and future. They are an independent existence
because they are a flashing into the vast phenomenal world.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
%
You are independent, and I am independent; each exists in a different moment.
But this does not mean we are quite different beings. We are actually one and
the same being. We are the same, and yet different. It is very paradoxical, but
actually it is so.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
%
When I am sitting, there is no other person, but this does not mean I ignore
you, I am completely one with every existence in the phenomenal world. So when I
sit, you sit; everything sits with me. That is our zazen. When you sit,
everything sits with you. And everything makes up the quality of your being. I
am a part of you. I go into the quality of your being. So in this practice we
have absolute liberation from everything else. If you understand this secret
there is no difference between Zen practice and your everyday life.

Dogen-zenji became interested in Buddhism as a boy as he watched the smoke from
an incense stick burning by his dead mother's body, and he felt the evanescence

of enlightenment and the development of his deep philosophy. When he saw the
smoke from the incense stick and felt the evanescence of life, he felt very
lonely. But that lonely feeling became stronger and stronger, and flowered into
enlightenment when he was twenty-eight years old.

The seed has no idea ofbeing some particular plant, but it has its own form and
is in perfect harmony with the groimd, with its surroundings. As it grows, in
the course of time it expresses its nature. Nothing exists without form and

in perfect harmony with other beings.

For a plant or stone to be natural is no problem. But for us there is some
problem, indeed a big problem. To be natural is something which we must work on.
When what you do just comes out from nothingness, you have quite a new feeling.
For instance, when you are hungry, to take some food is naturalness. You feel
natural. But when you are expecting too much, to have some food is not natural.
You have no new feeling. You have no appreciation for it.

As long as we have some definite idea about or some hope in the future, we
cannot really be serious with the moment that exists right now. You may say, "I

Each one of us must make his own true way, and when we do, that way will express
the universal way. This is the mystery. When you understand one thing through
and through, you understand everything. When you try to understand everything,
you will not understand anything. The best way is to understand yourself, and
then you will understand everything. So when you try hard to make your own way,
you will help others, and you will be helped by others. Before you make your own
way you cannot help anyone, and no one can help you.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind

So we say true understanding will come out of emptiness. When you study
Buddhism, you should have a general house cleaning of your mind. You must take
everything out of your room and clean it thoroughly. If it is necessary, you may
bring everything back in again. You may want many things, so one by one you can
bring them back. But if they are not necessary, there is no need to keep them.

at one spot you will be tired in about five minutes. This is not concentration.

should be concentrated on nothing.

Thus we realize the true meaning of each tentative existence. When we first hear
that everything is a tentative existence, most of us are disappointed; but this
disappointment comes from a wrong view of man and nature. It is because our way
of observing things is deeply rooted in our self-centered ideas that we are
disappointed when we find everything has only a tentative existence. But when we
actually realize this truth, we will have no suffering.

This sutra says, "Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara observes that everything is
emptiness, thus he forsakes all suffering." It was not after he realized this
truth that he overcame suffering — to realize this fact is itself to be relieved
from suffering. So realization of the truth is salvation itself.

. . .

We say, "to realize," but the realization of the truth is always near at hand.
It is not after we practice zazen that we realize the truth; even before we
practice zazen, realization is there. It is not after we understand the truth
that we attain enlightenment. To realize the truth is to live — to exist here
and now. . . . . In this sutra Buddha is referring to the ultimate fact that we
always face moment after moment . . . . This is Bodhidharma's zazen. Even before
we practice it, enlightenment is there.

. . .

Usually we understand the practice of zazen and enlightenment as two different
things: here is practice, like a pair of glasses, and when we use the practice,
like putting the glasses on, we see enlightenment. This is the wrong
understanding. The glasses themselves are enlightenment, and to put them on is
also enlightenment. So whatever you do, or even though you do not do anything,
enlightenment is there, always.

While you are practicing zazen, you may hear the rain dropping from the roof in
the dark. Later, the wonderful mist will be coming through the big trees, and
still later when people start to work, they will see the beautiful mountains.
But some people will be annoyed if they hear the rain when they are lying in
their beds in the morning, because they do not know that later they will see the
beautiful sun rising from the east. If our mind is concentrated on ourselves we
will have this kind of worry. But if we accept ourselves as the embodiment of
the truth, or Buddha nature, we will have no worry. We will think, "Now it is
raining, but we don't know what will happen in the next moment. By the time we
go out it may be a beautiful day, or a stormy day. Since we don't know, let's

Each existence depends on something else. Strictly speaking, there are no
separate individual existences. There are just many names for one existence.
Sometimes people put stress on oneness, but this is not our understanding. We do
not emphasize any point in particular, even oneness. Oneness is valuable, but
variety is also wonderful. Ignoring variety, people emphasize the one absolute
existence, but this is a one-sided understanding. In this understanding there is

Dogen-zenji said, "Although everything has Buddha nature, we love flowers, and
we do not care for weeds." This is true of human nature. But that we are
attached to some beauty is itself Buddha's activity. That we do not care for
weeds is also Buddha's activity. We should know that. If you know that, it is
all right to attach to something. If it is Buddha's attachment, that is
non-attachment.

So in love there should be hate, or non-attachment. And in hate there should be
love, or acceptance. Love and hate are one thing. We should not attach to love

them.

way to grasp anything; there is no thing to grasp. We cannot put emphasis on any

a weed grows, even though we do not love it." Even though it is so, this is our
life.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind

Because we put emphasis on some particular point, we always have trouble. We
should accept things just as they are. This is how we understand everything, and
how we live in this world. This kind of experience is something beyond our
thinking. In the thinking realm there is a differ- ence between oneness and
variety; but in actual experience, variety and unity are the same.

without anything covering it, we do not feel that roundness the same way we do
when we see it through something else.

When you are doing zazen, you are within the complete calmness of your mind; you
do not feel anything. You just sit. But the calmness of your sitting will
encourage you in your everyday life. So actually you will find the value of Zen
in your everyday life, rather than while you sit. But this does not mean you
should neglect zazen. Even though you do not feel anything when you sit, if you
do not have this zazen experience, you cannot find anything; you just find
weeds, or trees, or clouds in your daily life; you do not see the moon. That is
why you are always complaining about something. But for Zen students a weed,
which for most people is worthless, is a treasure. With this attitude, whatever
you do, life becomes an art.

In our everyday life we are usually trying to do something, trying to change
something into something else, or trying to attain something. Just this trying
is already in itself an ex- pression of our true nature. The meaning lies in the
effort itself. We should find out the meaning of our effort before we attain
something. So Dogen said, "We should attain enlight- enment before we attain
enlightenment." It is not after at- taining enlightenment that we find its true
meaning. The trying to do something in itself is enlightenment. When we are in
difficulty or distress, there we have enlightenment. When we are in defilement,
there we should have composure. Usually we find it very difficult to live in the
evanescence of life, but it is only within the evanescence of life that we can
find the joy of eternal life.

successful? If you do not know the answer, you will not even be able to practice

To practice zazen with a group is the most important thing for Buddhism — and
for us — because this practice is the orig- inal way of life. Without knowing
the origin of things we cannot appreciate the result of our life's effort. Our
effort must have some meaning. To find the meaning of our effort is to find the
original source of our effort. We should not be concerned about the result of
our effort before we know its origin. If the origin is not clear and pure, our
effort will not be pure, and its result will not satisfy us. When we resume our
original nature and incessantly make our effort from this base, we will
appreciate the result of our effort moment after moment, day after day, year
after year. This is how we should appreciate our life. Those who are attached
only to the result of their effort will not have any chance to appre- ciate it,
because the result will never come. But if moment by moment your effort arises
from its pure origin, all you do will be good, and you will be satisfied with
whatever you do.

As Buddhists our traditional effort should be like Buddha's: we should not
attach to any particular school or doctrine.

Because Buddha was the founder of the teaching, people tentatively called his
teaching "Buddhism," but actually Buddhism is not some particular teaching.
Buddhism, is just Truth, which includes various truths in it. Zazen practice is
the practice which includes the various activities of life. So actually, we do
not emphasize the sitting posture alone. How to sit is how to act. We study how
to act by sitting, and this is the most basic activity for us . . . . Buddha
taught us how to act through our practice; that is why we sit.

-- Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
%
To do something, to live in each moment, means to be the temporal activity of
Buddha. To sit in this way is to be Buddha himself, to be as the historical
Buddha was. The same thing applies to everything we do. Everything is Buddha's
activity. So whatever you do, or even if you keep from doing something, Buddha
is in that activity.

Without knowing . . . people put emphasis on some activity. When they put
emphasis on zazen, it is not true zazen.

So Dogen did not call himself a Soto teacher or a Soto disciple. He said, "Other
people may call us the Soto school, but there is no reason for us to call
ourselves Soto. You should not even use the name of Soto." No school should
consider itself a separate school. It should just be one tentative form of
Buddhism. But as long as the various schools do not accept this kind of
understanding, as long as they continue calling themselves by their particular
names, we must accept the tentative name of Soto. But I want to make this point
clear. Actually we are not the Soto school at all. We are just Buddhists. We are
not even Zen Buddhists; we are just Bud- dhists. If we understand this point we
are truly Buddhists.

To realize pure mind in your delusion is practice, If you try to expel the
delusion it will only persist the more. Just say, 'Oh, this is just delusion, '
and do not be bothered by it.

When you have something in your consciousness you do not have perfect composure.
The best way towards perfect composure is to forget everything. Then your mind
is calm, and it is wide and clear enough to see and feel things as they are
without any effort. The best way to find perfect composure is not to retain any
idea of things, whatever they may be — to forget all about them and not to leave
any trace or shadow of thinking. But if you try to stop your mind or try to go
beyond your conscious activity, that will only be another burden for you. "I
have to stop my mind in my practice, but I cannot. My practice is not so good."
This kind of idea is also the wrong way of practice. Do not try to stop your
mind, but leave everything as it is. Then things will not stay in your mind so
long. Things will come as they come and go as they go. Then eventually your
clear, empty mind will last fairly long.

So to have a firm conviction in the original emptiness of your mind is the most
important thing in your practice. In Buddhist scriptures we sometimes use vast
analogies in an attempt to describe empty mind. Sometimes we use an
astronomically great number, so great it is beyond counting. This means to give
up calculating. If it is so great that you cannot count it, then you will lose
your interest and eventually give up.

You know how to rest physically. You do not know how to rest mentally. Even
though you lie in your bed your mind is still busy; even if you sleep your mind
is busy dreaming. Your mind is always in intense activity. This is not so good.
We should know how to give up our thinking mind, our busy mind. In order to go
beyond our thinking faculty, it is necessary to have a firm conviction in the
emptiness of your mind. Believing firmly in the perfect rest of our mind, we
should resume our pure original state.

Dogen-zenji said, "You should establish your practice in your delusion." Even
though you think you are in delusion, your pure mind is there. To realize pure
mind in your delusion is practice. If you have pure mind, essential mind in
your delusion, the delusion will vanish.

To have delusion is practice. This is to attain enlightenment before you realize
it. Even though you do not realize it, you have it. So when you say, "This is
delusion," that is actually enlightenment itself. If you try to expel the
delusion it will only persist the more, and your mind will become busier and
busier trying to cope with it. That is not so good. Just say, "Oh, this is just
delusion," and do not be bothered by it. When you just observe the delusion, you
have your true mind, your calm, peaceful mind. When you start to cope with it
you will be involved in delusion.

Usually religion develops itself in the realm of conscious- ness, seeking to
perfect its organization, building beautiful buildings, creating music, evolving
a philosophy, and so forth. These are religious activities in the conscious
world. But Buddhism emphasizes the world of unconsciousness. The best way to
develop Buddhism is to sit in zazen — just to sit, with a firm conviction in our
true nature. This way is much better than to read books or study the philosophy
of Bud- dhism. Of course it is necessary to study the philosophy — it will
strengthen your conviction . . . . But philosophical discussion will not be the
best way to understand Buddhism. If you want to be a sincere Buddhist, the best
way is to sit.

The big mind in which we must have confidence is not something which you can
experience objectively. It is some- thing which is always with you, always on
your side. Your eyes are on your side, for you cannot see your eyes, and your
eyes cannot see themselves. Eyes only see things outside, ob- jective things. If
you reflect on yourself, that self is not your true self any more. You cannot
project yourself as some ob- jective thing to think about. The mind which is
always on your side is not just your mind, it is universal mind, always the
same, not different from another's mind. It is Zen mind. It is big, big mind.
This mind is whatever you see. Your true mind is always with whatever you see.
Although you do not know your own mind, it is there — at the very moment you see
something, it is there. This is very interesting. Your mind is always with the
things you observe. So you see, this mind is at the same time everything.

Do you understand? If you try to attain enlightenment as if you see a bright
star in the sky, it will be beautiful and you may think, "Ah, this is
enlightenment," but that is not en- lightenment. That understanding is literally
heresy. Even though you do not know it, in that understanding you have the idea
of material only. Dozens of your enlightenment ex- periences are like that —
some material only, some object of your mind, as if through good practice you
found that bright star. That is the idea of self and object. It is not the way
to seek for enlightenment.

Physical practice and rules are not so easy to understand, maybe especially for

Little by little with patience and endurance we must find the way for ourselves,
find out how to live with ourselves and with each other. If we practice hard,
concentrate on zazen, and organize our life so that we can sit well, we will
find out what we are doing. But you have to be careful in the rules and way you
establish. If it is too strict you will fail, if it is too loose, the rules will
not work.

But once the rules have been decided, we should obey them completely until they

You must put confidence in the big mind which is always with you. You should be

or layman is not the point. To find yourself as someone who is doing something

Zen is not just for the man who can fold his legs or who has great spiritual
ability. Everyone has Buddha nature. We each must find some way to realize our
true nature. The purpose of practice is to have direct experience of the Buddha
nature which everyone has. Whatever you do should be the direct experience of
Buddha nature. Buddha nature means to be aware of Buddha nature. Your effort
should extend to saving all sentient beings.

We must have beginner's mind, free from possessing anything, a mind that knows
everything is in flowing change. Nothing exists but momentarily in its present

new growth. In the East I saw rhubarb already. In Japan in the spring we eat

Gotama invited his followers to engage in an interconnected set of four
tasks. These tasks challenge us to embrace suffering, let our reactive emotions
be, see the stopping of reactivity, and respond with care. When facing a climate
emergency that threatens the viability of intelligent life on Earth, this would
entail embracing the possibility of extinction, not being paralyzed by the fear
of extinction, dwelling in a space of fearless awareness, and, from there,
responding appropriately to the threats that face us and future generations. The
four tasks flesh out what it means to care. For Gotama, care is the cardinal
virtue that encompasses all others. His final recorded words were: “Things fall
apart; tread the path with care.”

To think in a more contemplative way means to slow down and recover our
rootedness on Earth, which allows us to ponder and question what kind of beings
we are and how best to live in this world. Heidegger called this kind of
questioning the “piety of thinking.” At the heart of such contemplation lies the
need to become more aware of our technological relationship to nature. This
technical approach has proved so successful in everything from building
skyscrapers to eliminating polio that many today regard it as simply the most
reasonable way to conduct their lives. As a result, they find themselves
treating life itself—and their own lives in particular—as problems to be solved
by application of the right techniques.

For another 20th-century philosopher, the French writer Gabriel Marcel, our
existential condition of having been born and being subject to death is not a
problem to be eradicated but a mystery to be embraced. A problem, for Marcel,
always stands apart from the one confronting it, whereas a mystery is
inseparable from the one who embraces it. As the person who falls sick, ages,
and is destined to die, I cannot stand outside these processes in order to treat
them as problems to be solved. Instead, I can open myself to the mystery of
being here and embrace it in wordless astonishment. Unlike a problem, which
vanishes as soon as it is solved, the more deeply we penetrate a mystery the
more mysterious it becomes.

In coming to view life through the lens of technology, we risk losing a sense of
our unfathomable poignancy and strangeness. In order to manipulate technically
the physical and mental elements of our world, they need to appear to us as
discrete, definable, readily graspable objects. Only then can we confidently
embark on bending them to our will. “A world where techniques are paramount,”
remarked Marcel, “is a world given over to desire and fear; because every
technique is there to serve some desire or fear.”

And if you find you just can’t do this on certain days, no problem. Everyone has
days like that. Everyone. Me, you, Dogen, the Dalai Lama, all of us. Effort is
more important than so-called success because effort is a real thing. What we
call “success” is just the manifestation of our mind’s ability to categorize
things. This is “success.” That is “failure.” Who says? You says. That’s
all. Reality is what it is, beyond all concepts of success and failure.

FIVE VOWS

I vow to myself and to each of you:

To commit myself daily to the healing of our world and the welfare of all
beings.

To live on earth more lightly and less violently in the food, products, and
energy I consume.

To draw strength and guidance from the living earth, the ancestors, the future
beings, and my brothers and sisters of all species.

To support others in their work for the world and to ask for help when I feel
the need.

To pursue a daily spiritual practice that clarifies my mind, strengthens my
heart, and supports me in observing these vows.

I asked the leaf whether it was frightened because it was autumn and the other
leaves were falling.

The leaf told me, “No. During the whole spring and summer I was completely
alive. I worked hard to help nourish the tree, and now much of me is in the
tree. I am not limited by this form. I am also the whole tree, and when I go
back to the soil, I will continue nourish the tree. So I don’t worry at all. As
I leave this branch and float to the ground, I will wave to the tree and tell
her, ‘I will see you again very soon.”

Dear Friends,

It seems that causes and conditions are no longer sufficient for me to continue
this manifestation. I am getting weaker each day. It has been a very deep
practice of acceptance and letting go. I am left with a heart filled with
gratitude for having been given the gift of this wonderful lifetime.  For having
met Thay in this lifetime and for having been able to share what he shared with
me and to be a part of this beautiful family. To have been loved unconditionally
and to be able to love in that way is the most precious gift. And of course to
have been blessed with a partner who has been a wonderful teacher of true love.

So left with no words but Thank You and

I love you all,
Joanne [Friday]
