For just as a drowning man is no more able to breathe if he be not far from the
surface of the water, so that he might at any moment emerge, than if he were
actually at the bottom already . . . similarly a man that has made some progress
towards the state of virtue is none the less in misery than he that has made no
progress at all.

Since only this inner poise mattered, the Stoic, though eager to do his duty,
was not to be disturbed by any failure, provided the failure was due to
circumstances beyond his control. This strange combination of zeal in action,
indifference to results, and distrust of all passions and emotions which might
disturb the Stoic's inner poise . . .

Under the despotic emperors who exacted a sullen obedience from the Senate,
Stoicism had been the religion of the opposition; indeed, i twas the Stoic
temper which made that opposition dangerous. Many chose to die as Stoics rather
than live as slaves. For if one's duty was done, then, as the Stoics put it,
"The door is open."

Man needs to beuld emotional defenses to retain his sanity, and one who really
felt the sufferings of all other men as his own would be of little use either to
himself or indeed to the sufferers; but, on the other hand, man also needs
emotional motivation, and anyone who intellectually seeds injustice all around
him but feels no anger or indignation is not likely to do much to correct it.

The Greeks, for all their ideas on the federation of nations and their many
experiments, never in practice solved the urgent social-political problem of
establishing the supra-city-state political and social structure which the times
demanded. The Romans, when their day came, did solve that problem, and the sword
was not their only instrument. But by that time "captive Greece han conquered
her rude conqueror," as Horace put it, and the Romans, enslaved as they were to
the Greeks in matters of thought, never developed a philosophy of life
commensurate with their practical achievement. They merely tried to apply Greek
ideas to their very different Roman world. No wonder something was lacking.

The lack is felt in Marcus Aurelius, but it was not a personal failure so much
as a failure of the world in which he lived. He was not a happy man, obviously,
but he was a very great one; he not only had high ideals but he lived up to them
as few men have been capable of doing. His journal is not a cheerful book, but
it is a noble book, and at the same time very personal and touching. It is not
often that we can share the innermost thoughts of a man of his quality in his
terribly responsible position.

We can, I believe, find much in it to help us in our own lives, in our own
thoughts and actions; for we too live in a world where the idealist who works to
realize his ideals may well, like Marcus, at times feel very tired and very
close to despair. Stoicism may not have made him happy, but it gave him faith,
strength, and courage, and it kept despair at bay.

From my great-grandfather: . . . to have good teachers at home, and know that
one should spend freely on such things.

From Rusticus: to come to realize that one's character needs correction and
training; not to be sidetracked into the pursuit of the rhetoric of the
Sophists, not to write about one's theories or preach one's little sermons, not
to show off by posing as a trained philosopher or a benefactor; to abstain from
rhetoric and poetry and clever talk; not to walk about the house in full regalia
or do things of that sort; to write letters in a simple style like the letter
Rusticus himself wrote to my mother from Sinoessa; to be ready to resume
friendly rela- tions with those who have annoyed or wronged you as soon as they
themselves want to resume them; to read with care and not to be satisfied with a
general understanding of the subject or agree easily with superficial chatter;
an acquaintance with the works of Epictetus, of which he lent me his own copy.

From Apollonious: . . . to be the same man always, when in great pain, at the
loss of a child, or during a long illness; clearly to realize from his living
example, that the same man can be very much in earnest and yet relaxed; not to
be impatient in explanation; observing a man who obviously considered his
experience and skill in communicating his ideas the least of his
accomplishments.

Form Sextus: kindliness . . . affectionate consideration for one's friends'
feelings; to be tolerant of the uncultured and of those whose opinions are not
thought out; to be accommodating to all men . . . to be quite unperturbed and
yet very affectionate; to prauise without fuss, and to be very learned without
ostentation.

From Alexander the Platonist: only rarely and when unavoidable to say or to
write to someone, "I am too busy," and not in this way, on the plea of pressing
business, to continually excuse ourselves from performing th eduties we owe to
those who live with us.

From Catulus: not to ignore a friend's criticism even if it happens to be
unreasonable but to try to restore his usual friendliness; to speak of one's
teachers with heartfelt respect . . . to be genuinely fond of children.

From Severus: love of family, love of truth, love of justice . . . to grasp the
idea of a Commonwealth with the same laws for all, governed on the basis of
equality and free speech, also the idea of a monarchy which prizes the liberty
of its subjects above all things . . . a vigorous consistency in the
appreciation of philosophy; beneficence, eager generosity, and optimism;
confidence in the affection of one's friends, and frankness towards those who
incurred his censure; so that his friends had no need to guess at his desires or
intentions, but they were obvious.

From Maximus: self-control, not to be easily influenced; to be of good cheer in
illness and in all other misfortunes: a well- balanced disposition, sweet
temper, dignified bearing; to per- form one's appointed task without resentment;
the fact that all men trusted him to mean what he said and to do whatever he did
without malice; to be immune to surprise, undaunted, never hasty, dilatory or at
a loss, never to be downcast or sneer- ing or again angry or suspicious, but
generous, forgiving, and truthful; to give the impression of one who cannot be
corÂ· rupted rather than of one who has been reformed. Also, that no one thought
himself slighted by him, or would venture to consider himself his superior.

From my father: to be gentle, and to stick unwaveringly to decisions taken after
due investigations; not to take an empty pride in what are considered honors; to
love work and to persevere in it; to listen to those who have something to
contribute to the common good; to give to each man impartially what he deserves;
to know from experience when there is need for exertion, and when for relaxation
. . . to investigate carefully such matters as came before Council: he would
persevere in this, did not give up easily, and was never satisfied with first
impressions; to keep one's friends, and never be fickle or infatuated; to be
master of oneself in everything, and to be of good cheer; to look far ahead, and
to manage everyday affairs without dramatics. Public acclamations and every form
of flattery were checked in his reign.

To watch always over the essential needs of the empire, to allocate its
resources, and to tolerate criticism in these matters. To be free from
superstitious fear of the gods and not to court the favor of men by being
obsequious or seeking to please the mob; to be sober and steadfast in all
things; never to lack good taste nor to pursue novelty for its own sake; to use
the comforts of life without arrogance or apology when fortune provides them in
abundance, so as to enjoy them when they are available, without making a
practice of it, and not to feel the lack of them when they are not; . . . one
who is above flattery and able to manage his own affairs and those of others.

Beside this, to honor genuine philosophers, not reproaching the other kind but
not being influenced by them; to be sociable and agreeable, but not to excess,
moderately careful of one's own bodily health, not like a man in love with
living or with a view to beautifying oneself, yet at the same time not despis-
ing one's body, so that by paying attention to details oneself, one very rarely
needs medical help, medicines, and slaves; most important, to yield without
malice to those who have special ability, be it in expression, in the study of
laws or customs or other matters, and to give them help in their pursuits, so
that each of them may achieve distinction in his own field; to act in all things
in accordance with the traditions of our fathers without making this very thing
one's aim, namely to be noted for preserving the traditions of our fathers; not
to be always chopping and changing, moving from place to place and from one
course of action to another; after the most violent headaches to return to
one's customary tasks with renewed vigor; there were not many things which could
not be mentioned to him, for his secrets were few and far between, and
exclusively concerned with matters of state; reasonable moderation in providing
public spectacles, in carrying out public works, in the distribution of bounty
~mel the like, for he was a man who acted with an eye to what needed to be done,
not to the glory he could get from doing it.

His manner was never harsh, inexorable or violent; no one could say it was
heated. All business was allotted its calculated time as if he were a man of
leisure; and every item was dealt with in calm, orderly, vigorous, and
consistent manner, within its allotted time. What we are told of Socrates could
be suit- ably applied to him: that he could either abstain from, or en- joy,
those pleasures which most men are too weak to abstain from, or to enjoy without
complete surrender to them. Strength of character, self-control, and sobriety,
both in abstention and in enjoyment, belong to the man who has a perfect and
invincible spirit such as Maximus displayed in his illness.

It is possible to live in a palace without feeling the need of bodyguards or

Say to yourself in the morning: I shall meet people who are interfering,
ungracious, insolent, full of guile, deceitful and antisocial; they have all
become like that because they have no understanding of good and evil. But I . .

.We were born to labor together, like the feet, the hands, the eyes, and the
rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against one another is therefore contrary
to nature, and to be angry against a man or turn one's back on him is to work
against him.

It is possible to depart from life at this moment. Have this thought in mind
whenever you act, speak, or think. There is nothing terrible in leaving the
company of men, if the gods exist, for they would not involve you in evil. If,
on the other hand, they do not exist or do not concern themselves with human
affairs, then what is life to me in a universe devoid of gods or of Providence?

How swiftly all things vanish; in the universe the bodies themselves, and in

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.

Even if you were to live three thousand years or three times ten thousand,
remember nevertheless that no one can shed another life than this which he is
living, nor live another life than this which he is shedding, so that the
longest and the shortest life come to the same thing. The present is equal for
all, and that which is being lost is equal, and that which is being shed is thus
shown to be but a moment. No one can shed that which is past, nor what is still
to come; for how could he be deprived of what he does not possess?

Therefore remember these two things always: first, that all things as they come
round again have been the same from eternity, and it makes no difference whether
you see the same things for a hundred years, or for two hundred years, or for an
infinite time; second, that the longest-lived or the shortest-lived sheds the
same thing at death, for it is the present moment only of which he will be
deprived, if indeed only the present moment is his, and no man can discard what
he does not have.

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.

The human soul violates itself most of all when it becomes, as far as it can,
a separate tumor or growth upon the universe; for to be discontented with
anything that happens is to rebel against that Nature which embraces, in some
part of itself, all other natures.

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.
%
In human life time is but a point, reality a flux, perception indistinct, the
composition of the body subject to easy corruption, the soul a spinning top,
fortune hard to make out, fame confused. To put it briefly: physical things are
but a flowing stream, things of the soul dreams and vanity; life is but a
struggle and the visit to a strange land, posthumous fame but a forgetting.

What then can help us on our way? One thing only: philosophy.

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.
%
We must consider not only this, namely that our life is spent day by day and
that a smaller portion of it remains, but we must also take into account that it
is doubtful whether, if a man live long, his mind will retain an equal and
sufficient capacity for the understanding of events and for that theoretical
contemplation which contributes to the experience and knowledge of things divne
and human . . . . We must therefore hasten on, not meerly because death comes
closer every day, but because our understanding of events and our ability to act
on such understanding come to an end before we do.

When a loaf of bread is being baked, some parts break open, and these cracks,
which are not intended by the baker's craft, somehow stand out and arouse in us
a special eagerness to eat; figs, too, burst open when they are very ripe, and
the very closeness of decay adds a special beauty to olives that have ripened on
the tree.

The same is true of ears of wheat as they bend to the ground, of the wrinkles of
a lion's brow, of the foam flowing from a boar's mouth, and of many other things
. . . . As a result, the man of feeling and deeper understanding of the
phenomena in Nature as a whole will find almost all these incidents pleasantly
contrived . . . . He will see a kind of fulfillment and freshness in the old.

[ . . . ]

Many such things will not appeal to everyone, but only to the man who has come
to be genuinely at home with Nature and her works.

Hippocrates cured many diseases and then died of disease himself. The Chaldeans
foretold many deaths and then their own death overtook them. Alexander, Pompey,
and Julius Caesar many times utterly destroyed whole cities, cut down many
myriads of cavalrly and infantry in battle, and then came the day of their own
death. Heraclitus, as a natural philosopher, spoke at great length of the
conflagration of the universe; he was a victim of dropsy, covered himself with
cow dung, and died. Democritus was killed by vermin, and Socrates by another
kind of vermin.

What does it mean? You embarked, you sailed, you came to harbor. Disembark now;
if to another life, nothing is void of gods even there; if to insensibility, you
will cease to endure pleasures and pains. . .

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.

It is not lawful for . . . the praise of men, offices of power, wealth, or the
enjoyment of pleasures . . . to stand in the way of what is reasonable and for
the common good. All these things, even if for a while they seem to accord with
the good life, suddendly overwhelm one and lead one astray. Do you, I say, in
freedom and simplicity choose the better part and cling to it.

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.
%
Discard all else; cling to these few things only. Remember, moreover, that each
man lives only his present moment; as for the rest, either it has been lived in
the past or it is but an uncertain future. Small is the moment which eath man
lives, small too the corner of the earth which he inhabits; even the greatest
posthumous fame is small, and it too depends upon a succession of short lived
men who will die very soon, who do not know even themeselves, let alone who died
long ago.

The attitude of that which rules within us toward outside events . . . does not
direct its affection upon any particular set of circumstances t owork upon, but
it starts out towards its objects with reservations, and converts any obstacle
into material for its own action, as fire does when it overpowers what is thrown
upon it. A small flame might be quenched by it, but a bright fire very rapidly
appropriates to itself whatever is put upon it, consumes it and rises higher
because of these obstacles.

Men seek retreats for themselves in country places, on beaches and mountains,
and you yourself are wont to long for such retreats, but that is altogether
unenlightened when it is possible at any hour you please to find a retreat
within yourself.

Grant yourself this withdrawal continually, and refresh yearself. Let these be
brief and elemental doctrines which when present will suffice to overwhelm all
sorrows and to send you back no longer resentful of the things to which you
return.

For what is it you resent? The wickedness of men? Reflect on the conclusion . .

Does paltry fame disturb you? Look how swiftis the forgetting of all things in
the chaoes of inifinite time before and after, how empty is noisy applause, how
liable to change and uncritical are those who seem to speak well of us, how
narrow the boundaries within which fame is confined. The whole earth is but a
point in the universe, and how small a part of the earth is the corner in which
you live. And how many are those who there will praise you, and what sort of men
are they?

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.
%
From now on keep in mind the retreat into this little territory within yourself.
Avoid spasms and tensions above all; be free and look at your troubles like a
man, a citizen, and a moral creature. Among the foremost things which you will
look into are these two: first, that external matters do not affect the soul but
stand quietly outside it, while true disturbances come from the inner judgment;
second, that everything you see has all but changed already and is no more. Keep
constantly in mind how many things you yourself have witnessed changes already.
The universe is change, life is understanding.

Death, like birth, is a mystery of nature. The one is a joining together of the
same lements into which the other is a dissolving . . . . Their nature

common good, and what you choose to do must be of that nature, not because

flattering, asserting themselves, suspecting, plotting, praying for the death of
others, grumbling at their present lot, falling in love, hoarding, longing for
consulships and kingships. But the life of those men no longer exists, anywhere.

Then turn to the times of Trajan; again, everything is the same; and that life
too is dead.

Contemplate and observe in the same way the records of the other periods of
time, indeed of whole nations: how many men have struggled eagerly and then,
after a little while, fell and were resolved into their elements.

struggling because they would not act in accord with their own nature . . . and

How many doctors have died who often knit their brows over their dying patients,
how many astrologers who had foretold the deaths of others as a matter of

tyranst who had used their power over men's lives with terrible brutality, as if
immortal themselves.

How often have not whole cities died . . . Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and
innumerable others.

Go over in your mind the dead whom you have known, one after the other: one paid
the last rites to a friend and was himself laid out for burial by a third, who
also died; and all in a short time.

Human affairs must be regards as ephemeral, and of little worth, yesterday

assisted at the burial of many and then were buried themselves.

honor the gods and praise them, to do good to men, bear with them and forbear.
As for all that lies within the limits of mere flesh and mere life, remember
that none of it belongs to you or is within your power.

Let it be a matter of indifference whether you are cold or warm when doing what
is fitting, whether you are nodding with sleep or have slept your fill, whether
men speak ill or well of you, whether you are dying or doing something else. For
death too is one of the actions of life, and we die as we perform it. Therefore,
even when dying, it is sufficent that one's present task is well fulfilled.

How useful, when roasted meats and other foods are before you, to see them in
your mind as here the dead body of a fish, there the dead body of a bird or a
pig. Or again, to think of Falernian wine as the juice of a cluster of grapes,
of a purple robe as sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a shellfish, and of
sexual intercourse as internal rubbing accompanied by a spasmodic ejection of
mucus.

What useful perceputal images these are! They go to the heart of things and
pierce right through them, so that you see things for what they are. You must do
this throughout life; when things appear too enticing, strip them naked, destroy
the myth which makes them proud. For vanity is a dangerous perverter of Reason,
and it is when you think your preoccupations mosth worthwhile that you are most
enthralled.

Some things are hurrying to be born, others are hurrying to have been, and some
part of that which is in process of being is already extinct. The streaming
changes renew the universe continually, as the unceasing passage of time ever
makes new the unending ages.

What, among the things which rush past, can a man hold in high honor? It is as
if one set out to love one of the sparrows flying past, and behold, it has
vanished out of sight. Shuch indeed is life itself for every man, like an
exhalation from the blood or a drawing breath from the air.

As is the inhaling of air once and exhaling it again, which we do every moment,
so too is the returning of the power of breathing as a whole, which you acquired
at birth yesterday or the day before, to the source from which you drew it.

Do all things as a disciple of Antoninus: imitate his keenness for logical
action, his always equable temper, his piety, the serenity of his features, his
sweetness, his lack of vainglory, his ambition to understand affairs. He
dismissed no course of action till he had fully examined and clearly grasped it.
He endured those who unjustly blamed him without blaming them in return. He
never rushed things. He did not listen to slander. He was an exact judge of
character and actions, but he was not given to reproaches, not afraid of rumors,
not suspicious, no sophist. He was satisfied with little in the way of a house,
of bedcovers, of clothes, food, and servants. He was fond of work and energetic,
able to remain at the same task till evening, without even needing to relieve
himself except at his usual hour, because of his scanty diet. His friendships
were constant and unchanging. He tolerated outspoken opposition to his ideas and
was glad if anyone showed him a better way. He was religious but free from
superstition. Be his disciple in all this, and may your last hour find you as
much at ease with your conscience as he was with his.

We all work together to one end, some of us with concious understanding, others
without knowing it, as Heraclitus, I believe, says that even those who sleep are
at work producing together what comes to be in the universe. Each makes a
different contribution, and even one who objects and tries to oppose and destroy
what comes to be, contributes befond his intention, for the universe needed even
him. For the rest, decide on which side you will take your place. For the Reason
which governs all will in any case make good use of you and admit you to a place
among its fellow workers and co-operators, but do not you become as trivial and
ridiculous a part of them as the line in the play mention by Chrysippus.

Note by G.M.A. Grube: What Chrysippus said is preserved by Plutach (Against the
Stoices, 1065d). It was to the effect that certain lines of comedy, in
themselves poor, yet contribute to the charm of the play when seen in their

If the gods made plans for me and for what should happen to me, they made the
right plans, for it is not easy even to conceive of a god counseling ill; and
what reason had they to harm me?

. . .

If they did not make plans for me in particular, yet they certainly planned the
general good, and as incidental consequences of this I should love and welcome
what happens to me.

If they do not plan at all -- this it is impious to believe, or else let us not
sacrifice or pray to them, not swear by them or do any of those other acts which
we ferform on the assumption that the gods are present and live alongside of us.
But if they do not make plans for any one of us in particular, yet may I plan
for myself and examine my own advantage. And the advantage of each is what is in
accord with his own make-up and his own nature, for my nature is rational and
social.

My city and my country, as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as I am a man, it is the
world. Therefore, only the things which are beneficial to these communities are
good for me.

As the performances in the ampitheater bore you because you are always seeing

Reflect continually that death has come to all sorts of men of all sorts of

willful, and even those who mocked at the fated briefness of human life itself
. . . . Reflect about all these, that they have long been dead.

This is nothing dreadful for them, and why should it be so for those who have
made no name at all for themselves? There is in this life only one thing of much
value, to live with truth and righteousness, and to be kind to liars and
sinners.

whatever remains of life as nature demands. Observe what it does demand, and let
nothing else distract you. You know from experience in how many directions you
have wandered, and that you did not find the good life anywhere, not in
reasoning, not in wealth, not in reputation, not in pleasures -- nowhere. Where
then is the good life to be found? In doing what the nature of man requires. And
how is one to do this? By holding fast to doctrines that direct one's desires

scapings in their workshop from the things they are making. They have a place to
throw these things, whereas the nature of the Whole has nothing outside itself.

To wonder if its art is that, keeping with its own limits, it changes back into
itself all inside those limits that seems to decay, grow old and useless, that
it makes these very things the source of new creations, so that it needs no

protects its own welfare, althuogh it shares the disturbances of the body. Nor
did I allow my doctors to give themselves airs, as if ther work was important,
but my life continued its right and proper course."

kind of herdsmen who effectively milk a wilder and more treacherous kind of
animal, namely humans.

The philosopher thinks that kings and hespots will be so busy doing this that
they will inevitably become as boorish and uncultured as the herdsmen, just as
the walls which surround them are like a sheepfold on the mountain. Marcus does
not quote exactly . . . but the reference is clear, and the thought is that the
life of a ruler is as restrictive and as unsuited to philosophy as that of a

Once a man has been bitten by the true doctrines, even the shortest well-known
quotation will remind him to feel neither pain nor fear, as for exapmle:

Leaves by the wind are scattered on the ground;
So with a human generation.

Short-lived as leaves are your children; as leaves, too, the loud and loyal
applause of your friends, and your enemies' curses, silent reproach, and
ridicule; as leaves, too, are those who will hand on your posthumous fame.

All these "graw as the spring season," then a breeze blows them down, and "the
forest grows others" in their place. For all thing shave one attribute in
common: they are short-lived, though you avoid them or pursue them as if they
would last forever. In a short while you too will close your eyes in death, and
he who carries you out to burial will almost at once be the object of another's
lament.

Note by G.M.A. Grube:
The reference is to Homer, Iliad VI. 146-49. The whole passage runs as follows:

Others will grow as forests bloom is springtime,

things they will say of an earnest man, but how many other reasons there are in
our case to make it a relief to be rid of us!

Reflect on this when you ar edying and you will depart more easily, thinking: "I
am leaving the kind of life in which even my associates, for whom I labored,
paryed and planned so much, are very willing to carre me to my grave, hoping
perhaps for some relief from my death."

Yet do not for that reason feel less kindly to them, but preserve yoru usual
self; be friendly, kindly, well-disposed. And do not go as one who is being torn
from life, but as on ewho dies at peace as his soul slips away from his body;
and so, too, leave your associates. For it was Nature who bound you to them and
associated you with them, and who now loosens the bond. I am thus set free as
from kinsmen, but without protest or violence. For this is in accord with
nature.

The rational soul travels through the whole universe and the void which
surrounds it, and observes its form; it stretches into infinity of time and
grasps and understands the periodic rebirth of the Whole; it observes that those
who come after us will see nothing new, nothing different from what our
predecessors saw, but in a sense a man of forty, if he has any intelligence, has
seen all teh past and all the future, because they are of the same kind as the
present.

Those who stand in our way as you proceed in accordance with the right Reason
will not be able to turn you away from a healthy course of action; but neither
should they be able to destroy your kindly feelings toward themselves. Watch
yourself on both counts: not only that your judgment and actions be steadast,
but that you remain well-disposed to those who try to put obstacles in your way
or otherwise annoy you. To be angry with them is just as much a weakness as to
abandod a course of action or to yield through fear. Both are deserters, the man
who desists from action and fields to fear an dthe man who allows his feelings
to be changed towards those who are by nature his kindred and friends.

How rotten and spurious ois the man who says: "I have decided to be
straightforward with you." What are you doing, fellow? You need not declare this
beforehand; the facts will speak for themselves. It need to be stamped on the
forehead. Honesty is at once clear from the tone of voice and the look of the
yes, just as a loved one at once knows all from the glance of his lovers. The
simple adn good man must be all of one piece, so that anyone who approaches him
will, whether he wants to or not, be as clearly aware of these virtues as he is
aware of the stench of the unwashed. But calculated simplicity is like a
dagger. Nothing is uglier than wolfish friendship. Avoid it at all costs. The
good, simple, kindly man looks these qualties, they are seen at once.

The external things remain still; it is we who make judgments upon them, and, as
it were, in scribe them upon our minds, though we need not so inscribe them, and
indeed we can erase immediately any such judgment which we have made without
being aware of it. Remember further that the attention we give to such things is
short-lived, and soon life will have ceased.

What then is intolerable in these things? If they are in accord with nature,
rejoice in them and they will be easy to bear; if they are contrary to them,
find out what is in accord with your nature, and hasten to that, even if it
brings you no fame, for every creature is forgiven if it seeks its own proper

One should guard equally against being angry with men and flattering them; both
are antisocial and lead to injury. Have this thought at hand when you are
getting angry: that violent feelings are not manly, but gentleness and calm and
both more human and more manly, it is the gentle man, not one who is angry or
hard to please, who has his protion of strength and sinews and courage. As such
a character is closer to imperturbability, so he is closer to power; anger is a
sign of weakness just as much as grief. Both have been wounded, and yielded to
the wound.
